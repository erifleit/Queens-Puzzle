# Queens-Puzzle

The Queens Puzzle is a puxxle in which you are meant to place 8 chess pieces in a chess board in such a way that no two pieces share the same column, row, or diagonal coordinates.

The algorithm in this code achieves this by the means of recursion in the function placer().

You can change the size of the board and the amount of queens for experimenting. Though for there to be a solution the number of queens must be equal or less than the width of the board (assuming a perfect square board).

Above 30 queens the code takes very long to conclude and with some computers it may take a very long time to achieve a solution.

This is an interesting way of solving this puzzle and a good case study for recursion.
